    p Please note that this project has just launched some days ago - many of the resources i have in my backlog have not been added yet.
    p I plan on adding more contents first, improve the site and then slap a backend behind it, were you can submit resources and vote on others.
    p It will also be able to manage your own favorite resources or mark some as done.

    p Thank you :)
